# Upgrading Gen AI Apps to Gemini 2.x

## Introduction
- Gemini 2.x Enhancements:
  - Contextual understanding
  - Reasoning and instruction following
  - Multimodal capabilities
- Business Value:
  - Productivity
  - Cost reduction
  - Customer satisfaction
  - Competitive edge

## Testing in AI Model Upgrades
- Regression Testing:
  - Software regression
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, latency, etc.)
- Evaluation Scope:
  - Data drift
  - Latency SLAs (load testing)

## Model Evaluation Types
- Offline Evaluation:
  - Static datasets
  - ML metrics
- Online Evaluation:
  - Real user feedback
  - Business KPIs
  - Required when no ground truth available

## Upgrade Path Criteria
- Model Regression Needed?
  - Offline
  - Online
  - Both
- Load Testing?
- Prompt Optimization?

## Additional Considerations
- User Type:
  - Internal
  - B2B
  - B2C
- Evaluation Complexity:
  - Ground truth availability
  - Toolchain dependencies
  - Use case complexity (RAG, agentic)

## Upgrade Paths

### Path 1: No Model Regression Test
- Only code and load testing
- Use case: internal chatbot
- Action: hot swap Gemini 2.x API

### Path 2: Offline Eval Only
- Predefined datasets and metrics
- Use cases:
  - Product catalog enhancement
  - Code generation
- Complexity: varies with toolchain

### Path 3: Online Eval Only
- Initial baseline from user feedback
- Use case: creative content generation
- Requires HITL, logging, monitoring

### Path 4: Both Offline & Online Eval
- Dual layer of evaluation needed
- Use cases:
  - Conversational search agents
  - Social assistants
- Comprehensive metrics coverage

## Embrace Periodic Model Upgrades
- Normalize upgrades in MLOps
- Regular evals, prompt tuning
- Achieve operational maturity
